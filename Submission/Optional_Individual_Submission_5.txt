I have completed the course "Introduction to Shell" from Datacamp. I have attached the certificate in this folder. 

Introduction to Shell course has 4 chapters. 
Chapter 1 : Manipulating files and directories
This chapter provided a brief introduction to the Unix shell. Basic commands like how to create, modify, and delete files and folders.
Chapter 2: Manipulating data.
In this chapter, they showed how to work with the data in the files that we accessed in the previous chapter.
Chapter 3:Combining tools
In this chapter , we  combined commands together to do new things. For example, using multiple commands together 
to select the data. Also this chapter showed commands for sorting data.
Chapter 4:Batch processing
In this chapter, we learnt how to write commands in order to  process many files at once. 
Then also learnt how the shell uses variables to store information. 
Chapter 5: Creating new tools
Here, i created commands on my own. using nano and editing the files and then running them.
